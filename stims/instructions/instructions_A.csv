Welcome to the experiment! Press the space bar to read through the following instructions.
"In this task, you'll respond to words and pictures using the 'A' and 'L' keys."
Please sit an arm's distance away from your laptop or desktop. Keep your left index finger over the 'A' key and your right index finger over the 'L' key.
"Please do not minimize this screen until you finish the task, or your data could be lost and your study credit could be affected."
"In each round of this task, you will see three items presented in this order: a picture, a word (colored blue), and another word (colored orange)."
"The FIRST word (in blue) may either be a good or bad description of what's happening in the picture. If it's a good description, press the 'A' key. If it's a bad description, press the 'L' key. "
"The SECOND word (in orange) may either be a real English word (for example, ""flying"") or a nonsense word (for example, ""flurking""). If it's a real English word, press the 'A' key. If it's a nonsense word, press the 'L' key. "
Please respond to both words as fast as you can. Remember that only the first word should be judged based on its relevance to the picture.
"On the next page, you'll see an example of what each trial looks like."
