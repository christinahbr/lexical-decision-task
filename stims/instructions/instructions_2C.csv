You have now completed the practice! Carefully read the following instructions about the full task.
"Unlike in the practice, you will NOT see a reminder to push a key under each word. You should still press the 'A' key for bad descriptions and real words and the 'L' key for good descriptions and nonwords as quickly as you can."
"Please pay attention! If you don't finish a majority of the trials, or if you make key presses before the words appear, your credit for the study may be affected."
"Finally, make sure NOT to minimize this screen, or your data may FAIL to be saved and your credit for the study may be affected."
Please allow up to 15 minutes to finish the task.
"When you are ready, press the space bar to begin the task."
