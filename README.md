# Naive realism under the hood: Evidence for the inhibition of alternative subjective construals

## Project Summary

This project investigates the neurocognitive basis of naïve realism—the tendency to experience one’s own interpretation of the world as objective,
while viewing alternative interpretations as biased or uninformed. Building on social psychological theories of subjective construal, the project 
proposes the inhibition of alternative construals as a candidate mechanism through which naïve realism may arise. Under this account, forming a 
coherent interpretation of a situation may involve suppressing competing interpretations, making alternatives feel less plausible or accessible.

Because naïve realism is difficult to assess via self-report alone, this work combines behavioral paradigms with neuroimaging to test predictions 
derived from this proposed mechanism. This lexical decision task is designed to assess whether integrating an initial interpretation 
of an ambiguous stimulus facilitates congruent interpretations and inhibits competing ones. 

## Study 2

Study 2 examines whether forming an initial interpretation of an ambiguous scene strengthens facilitation of congruent interpretations and 
inhibition of competing alternatives. Building on classic semantic priming work by Marcel, the study adapts a lexical decision paradigm to test 
a proposed mechanism of inhibition of alternatives at the scene level. Participants view word–image–word sequences depicting ambiguous actions 
(e.g., a person playing a guitar), where an initial priming word suggests a subjective construal of the image and a subsequent target word is either 
congruent or competitive with that construal.

Critically, Study 2 manipulates whether the image meaningfully integrates with the initial priming word (relevant vs. irrelevant), allowing a test of 
whether successful integration of a scene and construal amplifies facilitation of congruent interpretations and inhibition of competing ones. Participants 
complete a lexical decision task on the target word, enabling reaction-time measures of facilitation and inhibition. By crossing relevance (integration present 
vs. absent) with congruence (congruent vs. competitive), the study isolates how initial construal formation shapes downstream processing of alternative interpretations. 
The code in this repository implements the Study 2 task logic and analysis pipeline.
